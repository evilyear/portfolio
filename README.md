## About the project

This project was made wit a pourpose to hone my skills in laravel fullstack programming and as a addition to the classic curriculum vitae that is sent with job applications.
The structure is more complex than what is necessary for a singlepage webpage in order to present as many technicalities as possible.
The page was developed in locale, connected with a Git repository and from there uploaded to the domain.
I used Xampp for database pourposes locally and developed the code using laravel with Visual Studio Code following MVC pattern.
A 3 language version was planned and therefore I used two methods of possible translations, that include the usage of localization and the double underscore helper function and  astrotomic/laravel-translatable package for translatable models to remove the complexity in retrieving and storing multilingual model instances.
Almost every content showed on the page is coming from a database in order to avoid hard-coded content.
On the admin page, a registered administrator can create, add, edit tables. The CRUD operations have the necessary safety measures included, with warning signalizations and error information.
